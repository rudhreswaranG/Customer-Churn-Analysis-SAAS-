🗄️ SQL Data Modeling & Churn Analysis

After completing data cleaning and feature engineering in Python, all datasets were uploaded into Microsoft SQL Server for structured data modeling and analysis.

🔹 Data Characteristics

Out of the five datasets used:

Accounts dataset contained unique records (one row per Account ID)

All other datasets contained multiple historical records per Account ID:

Subscriptions: ~5,000 rows

Support Tickets: ~2,000 rows

Churn Events: ~600 rows

Feature Usage: ~25,000 rows

Directly joining these tables would lead to duplicate rows and inflated churn counts, making analysis unreliable.

🔹 SQL Modeling Approach

To ensure accurate churn analysis:

Separate SQL views were created for:

Subscriptions

Support Tickets

Feature Usage

Churn Events

Each view retained only the latest relevant record per Account ID based on date fields (such as end date, churn date, or ticket close date)

This ensured:

One row per account per dataset

Clean joins without duplication

Correct churn attribution

🔹 Final Churn Dataset Creation

A final churn view was created by:

Joining the Accounts table with all latest-record views

Using Account ID as the primary key

Selecting only churn-relevant attributes such as:

Tier & billing frequency

Seat range

Satisfaction score

Support resolution time

Churn reason and feedback

This final dataset contained one row per account and was optimized for Power BI analysis.

🔹 SQL-Based Churn Analysis

In addition to data preparation, churn was also analyzed in SQL across key business segments to identify churn patterns, including:

Tier (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)

Billing frequency (Monthly vs Annual)

Seat range

Satisfaction levels

Support resolution time

These analyses helped validate churn trends before visualization and ensured consistency between SQL results and Power BI insights.

🔹 Outcome

Accurate churn rates without duplication

Reliable segment-level churn analysis

A single, analysis-ready dataset for dashboarding

SQL modeling aligned with real-world BI practices
