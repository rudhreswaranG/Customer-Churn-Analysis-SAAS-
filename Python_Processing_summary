Python Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering Summary

Python was used as the initial data preparation layer before SQL modeling and Power BI visualizat

Objectives
- Clean raw SaaS datasets
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Create analysis-ready features for churn investigation
- Prepare a unified dataset for SQL and dashboard consumption

Datasets Processed
- Accounts data
- Subscriptions data
- Feature usage data
- Churn events data
- Support tickets data

Key Data Cleaning Steps
- Converted all date columns into proper datetime format
- Handled missing values in churn feedback, satisfaction scores, and ticket metrics
- Standardized numeric fields such as seat count and resolution time
- Ensured churned accounts always had valid reason and feedback categories

Feature Engineering Performed
- Created Seat Range Buckets to analyze churn by customer size
  - (e.g., 1–25, 26–50, 51–75, 76–100, Above 131)
- Created Resolution Time Buckets to evaluate support impact on churn
  - (e.g., 0–4 hrs, 5–8 hrs, 9–12 hrs, 13–24 hrs, Above 48 hrs)
- Filled missing churn reason codes for churned customers with meaningful categories

Output
- Generated cleaned, structured datasets
- Data was made ready for:
  - SQL view creation
  - Power BI dashboard modeling
  - Churn analysis and insights generation
